# Rubiks-Cube-Simulator
I made a Rubik's Cube simulator in Python using the PyGame and OpenGL libraries.

I did this project to get an introduction to the PyGame library, as well as apply my knowledge of linear albegra (linear transformations).

You run the Cube.py file to start the simulator. The cube is controlled through keyboard inputs as follows (and it follows conventional Rubik's Cube notation).

Turns:
----------
"r"           -> turn the right face clockwise 90 degrees

"shift" + "r" -> turn the right face counter-clockwise 90 degrees

"l"           -> turn the left face clockwise 90 degrees

"shift" + "l" -> turn the left face counter-clockwise 90 degrees

"u"           -> turn the up face clockwise 90 degrees

"shift" + "u" -> turn the up face counter-clockwise 90 degrees

"d"           -> turn the down face clockwise 90 degrees

"shift" + "d" -> turn the down face counter-clockwise 90 degrees

"f"           -> turn the front face clockwise 90 degrees

"shift" + "f" -> turn the front face counter-clockwise 90 degrees

"b"           -> turn the back face clockwise 90 degrees

"shift" + "b" -> turn the back face counter-clockwise 90 degrees

Rotations:
------------

"→"           -> rotate the cube clockwise about the y-axis

"←"           -> rotate the cube counter-clockwise about the y-axis

"↓"           -> rotate the cube clockwise about the x-axis

"↑"           -> rotate the cube counter-clockwise about the x-axis

"z"           -> rotate the cube clockwise about the z-axis

"x"           -> rotate the cube counter-clockwise about the z-axis
